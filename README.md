Simplifies ARIMA modeling by providing user interface and immediate
results. User can specify non-seasonal and or/seasonal AR, MA, and
difference terms as well as dummy & Fourier terms. Stationarity test,
model convergence, fit statistics, ACF & PACF plots, residual plots, and
white noise plots all provided. This package heavily uses the ‘forecast’
package by Rob Hyndman.
