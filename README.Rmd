Simplifies ARIMA modeling by providing user interface and immediate results. User can specify non-seasonal and or/seasonal AR, MA, and difference terms as well as dummy & Fourier terms. 
Stationarity test, model convergence, fit statistics, ACF & PACF plots, residual plots, and white noise plots all provided. This package heavily uses the 'forecast' package by Rob Hyndman.
